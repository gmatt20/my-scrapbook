# Cali Therapy Scrapbook

## Overview
I do not use any social media, however, I sometimes have a big urge to post photos and videos of my roadtrips and daily lifestyle and this can be contradictory. I have recently went to San Francisco and I have taken amazing photos and videos and made great edits, however there is no one to look! What can I do if I do not want to use social media? Using my current HTML and CSS skills, I can create my own social media! I have thought about making a digital scrapbook. I hope to create a complex and great personal website that show cases my skills and who I am. I also hope to challenge and solidfy my skills. Above all, I hope to learn something new and I can gurantee myself that I will!

### Reflection
It was a smooth sail programming experience. I used my 2 hours on the road of coming back home from San Francisco to program my idea. I was motivated by looking out of the car window and seeing the waving hills of Central California and the idea came to me. Since I have solid skills in HTML and CSS, it was a breeze to program it. Of course, after 2 weeks of break from coding, I was a little rusty, but my skills are retained and Day 1 shows it. Previously when I was programming 2 weeks ago, I struggled with layouts, positioning, and aligning. Today, I am proud to say that I know how to layout, position, and align! I genuinly feel accomplished and proud of myself. I am proud that I have made a successful navbar and responsive web design in the images. More development is needed in positions however, I am still learning positions! Otherwise I am proud of my first day.
